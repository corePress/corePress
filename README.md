# corePress

The objective of this project is to set some `core` mechanisms as the common ground for [calmPress](https://github.com/calmpress/calmpress) and [ClassicPress](https://github.com/classicpress/classicpress) in the form of core plugins and themes.

The idea is to have an empty skeleton and add the packages you want to use depending on your needs, without having a bloated system with unnecessary features you did not want in the first place.

Think of this project as the packagist for Press sites that let you respect FIG standards, which in our case should be `corePress-FIG` which a team of volunteers should assemble a committee to vote which standards should be added as part of the newly designed standards.
